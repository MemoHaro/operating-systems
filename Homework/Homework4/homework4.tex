\subsection*{Chapter 7}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item In the dining philosophers problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mutual Exclusion}: When a philosopher picks up a chopstick (a resource), no other philosopher may pick up the same chopstick.
\item \textbf{Hold and Wait}: When a philosopher picks up a chopstick, he/she waits for another chopstick before eating. So the philosopher is holding one resources, and waiting for another.
\item \textbf{No preemption}: In the dining philosophers problem, each person only gives up their chopsticks after eating. So each philosopher only releases his/her resources after eating is complete. No mention of preemption, such as an omniscient being to take chopsticks away from the philosophers.
\item \textbf{Circular Wait}: If each philosopher picks up one chopstick, then philosopher 1 waits for philosopher 2 to put down the chopstick, who waits for philosopher 3, who waits for 4, who waits for 5 who is waiting for the first one.
\end{itemize}
To end the deadlock any of these conditions must be eliminated.
Mutual exclusion could be eliminated by allowing a philosopher to steal the chopstick out of one of the others hand.
%Mutual exclusion cannot be eliminated because the chopsticks cannot be shared. Only one philosopher may use a chopstick at once.
This may have other problems but there would no longer be a deadlock.
Since circular wait implies hold and wait, we would only need to fix hold and wait and both of those conditions would no longer deadlock.
%To remove the hold and wait condition, ...
To remove hold and wait, it is similar to the solutions described for mutual exclusion; allow other philosophers to take chopsticks out of the others hand
To remove no preemption, we could have an omniscient philosopher which could remove chopsticks out of a philosopher's hand when he/she has been holding onto a resource too long.
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item If each process tries to aquire a resource, there will be one resource left over. The remaining resource can be given to any one of the process, and it will eventually finish. This situation will never deadlock.
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item If it is the last chopstick remaining, check if any other philosopher is currently eating, and if no one else is, wait.
\setcounter{enumi}{10}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \begin{tabular}{l r r r r }
    & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Need}
    \\
    \cline{2-5}
          & A & B & C & D\\
    $P_0$ & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    $P_1$ & 0 & 7 & 5 & 0\\
    $P_2$ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 2\\
    $P_3$ & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
    $P_4$ & 0 & 6 & 4 & 2
  \end{tabular}
  \item The system is in a safe state. One way the processes could run is: $P_0$, (Available = (1,5,3,2)), $P_3$, (Available = (1,11,6,4)), $P_1$ (Available = (2,11,6,4)), $P_4$, (Available = (2,11,7,8)). Thus, all processes are in a safe state.
  \item If a request arrives from process $P_1$ for (0,4,2,0). The request will reduce avaliable to (1,1,0,0). The system is still safe because we can run $P_0$, $P_2$, $P_3$, $P_1$, and $P_4$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{0}
\item \textbf{External Fragmentation}: Occurs when processes are loaded and removed from memory, and the free memory space is broken into little pieces. \textbf{Internal Fragmentation}: Memory that is internal to a partition but is not being used.
