\item In the dining philosophers problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mutual Exclusion}: When a philosopher picks up a chopstick (a resource), no other philosopher may pick up the same chopstick.
\item \textbf{Hold and Wait}: When a philosopher picks up a chopstick, he/she waits for another chopstick before eating. So the philosopher is holding one resources, and waiting for another.
\item \textbf{No preemption}: In the dining philosophers problem, each person only gives up their chopsticks after eating. So each philosopher only releases his/her resources after eating is complete. No mention of preemption, such as an omniscient being to take chopsticks away from the philosophers.
\item \textbf{Circular Wait}: If each philosopher picks up one chopstick, then philosopher 1 waits for philosopher 2 to put down the chopstick, who waits for philosopher 3, who waits for 4, who waits for 5 who is waiting for the first one.
\end{itemize}
To end the deadlock any of these conditions must be eliminated.
%Mutual exclusion could be eliminated by allowing a philosopher to steal the chopstick out of one of the others hand.
Mutual exclusion cannot be eliminated because the chopsticks cannot be shared. Only one philosopher may use a chopstick at once.
% This may have other problems but there would no longer be a deadlock.
Since circular wait implies hold and wait, we would only need to fix hold and wait and both of those conditions would no longer deadlock.
%To remove the hold and wait condition, ...
%To remove hold and wait, it is similar to the solutions described for mutual exclusion; allow other philosophers to take chopsticks out of the others hand
%To remove no preemption, we could have an omniscient philosopher which could remove chopsticks out of a philosopher's hand when he/she has been holding onto a resource too long.
