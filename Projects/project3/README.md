# Project 3: mywc

(15 points)

Write a program which simulates the UNIX's own wc command. In particular, your program should handle the options, c, l, and w, and be able to process zero or more files on the command line.

    -c --bytes	      print the byte counts
    -l --lines	      print the newline counts
    -w --words	      print the word counts
