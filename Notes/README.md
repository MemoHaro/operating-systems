# Comp322 - Introduction to Operating Systems

**CSUN Server**: k200.ecs.csun.edu

Best way to access (So we start with a bash shell):

    ssh -t k200.ecs.csun.edu bash

    or

    ssh -t k200.ecs.csun.edu exec -a bash -l bash

Not sure which one works better. Second one logs directly in I think

---

To print on the server:

    lp -d2215


## Note

Keep this branch seperate from the other branches so it is possible to clone just this branch onto the csun server.
